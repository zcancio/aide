George's highest: 103.0°F at 4pm Monday.

ER threshold typically 105°F or sustained 103°F+ unresponsive to meds. George hit 103° once, responded to motrin (dropped to 102.9 → 101.9 → 100.5 over next 28 hours).

Current concern: tylenol ineffective (stays 101-103 after doses), motrin works better. Swelling eyelids + vomiting Monday suggest secondary issues worth monitoring.

Not ER-urgent by temperature alone, but if eyelid swelling worsens, vomiting returns, or temp climbs back to 103°+ and holds, call pediatrician.
