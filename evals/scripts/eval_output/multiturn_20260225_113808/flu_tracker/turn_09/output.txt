Tylenol shows minimal effect for George:

AFTER TYLENOL DOSES
2am Mon: 102.7 → 6:30am still 102.7 (no drop in 4.5 hours)
2pm Mon: 101.3 → 3pm 101.9 (rose 0.6° in 1 hour)
7:40pm Tue: 100.5 (too recent to assess)

AFTER MOTRIN DOSES
10:30am Mon: 102.9 → 1:15pm 100.3 (dropped 2.6° in 2.75 hours)
4pm Mon: 103 → next reading unknown

Motrin shows clear reduction (2.6° drop). Tylenol shows minimal to no effect — fever either holds steady or rises. Pattern suggests George responds better to motrin.
