Tylenol shows minimal effect for George. Looking at his readings:

After Tylenol doses:
- 2am 102.7°F → 6:30am still 102.7°F (no change over 4.5 hours)
- 2pm 101.3°F → 3pm 101.9°F (increased 0.6°)
- 7:40pm 100.5°F (too recent to assess)

After Motrin doses:
- 10:30am 102.9°F → 1:15pm 100.3°F (dropped 2.6°)
- 4pm 103.0°F → (no reading yet, but previously effective)

Motrin consistently brings his temp down 2-3 degrees. Tylenol holds or climbs. The pattern suggests George responds significantly better to Motrin than Tylenol.
