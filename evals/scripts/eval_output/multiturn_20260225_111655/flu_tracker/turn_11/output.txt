George's highest: 103°F at 4pm Monday (Dec 30).

For ER guidance: fever alone doesn't determine ER need. Consider:
- Age matters (infants <3 months with fever >100.4 = ER immediately)
- Duration (fever >3-5 days warrants call to doctor)
- Behavior (lethargic, unresponsive, difficulty breathing, severe pain)
- Other symptoms (stiff neck, severe headache, rash, dehydration)

George's 103° is concerning but not ER-threshold on temp alone. The eye swelling at 11:30am Monday and vomiting at 2pm are more notable symptoms. If he's staying hydrated, responsive, and the fever responds to meds (even partially), urgent care or a doctor call in the morning is likely sufficient. If he becomes unresponsive, has trouble breathing, or the fever spikes above 105, that's ER territory.

Call the pediatrician's after-hours line for case-specific guidance.
