GEORGE PEAK: 103°F at 4pm Monday

ER guidance typically suggests going if:
- Temp 105°F or higher
- Fever lasts more than 3 days
- Child is lethargic, unresponsive, or has trouble breathing
- Severe symptoms (stiff neck, severe headache, rash)

George's 103°F is below the emergency threshold. He's been running fever for ~2 days (since 2am Monday). The eyelid swelling and vomiting on Monday are concerning symptoms — if those worsen or new symptoms appear, consider calling the pediatrician. The fever itself isn't ER-level yet, but the trajectory and symptoms matter.
