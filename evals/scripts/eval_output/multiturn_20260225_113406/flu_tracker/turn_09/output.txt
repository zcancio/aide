GEORGE TYLENOL EFFECTIVENESS

Readings after Tylenol doses:

2am: 102.7°F → dose Tylenol → 6:30am: 102.7°F (no change, 4.5 hours)
6:30am: 102.7°F → dose Tylenol → 9:25am: 101°F (dropped 1.7°F, 3 hours)
2pm: 101.3°F → dose Tylenol → 3pm: 101.9°F (rose 0.6°F, 1 hour)
7:40pm Tuesday: 100.5°F → too soon to measure

Tylenol reduced fever once (6:30am dose). Failed to reduce fever twice (2am dose held steady through morning, 2pm dose followed by rise). 

Motrin appears more effective: 10:30am dose (102.9°F → 100.3°F by 1:15pm, dropped 2.6°F) and 4pm dose helped sustain through evening.

Pattern suggests Tylenol isn't reliably controlling George's fever. Motrin shows better response.
