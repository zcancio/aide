Ringo's temps: 100.3 (3am) → 99.1 (6am) → 100.5 (8:40am) → 100.8 (1pm).

Pattern shows improvement then rebound. Watch for:

Sustained trend above 100°F despite meds — if next reading stays high 4-6 hours after tylenol, fever isn't breaking.

Timing between meds — tylenol given at 1pm, effective window is ~4-6 hours. Check again around 5-7pm to see if fever drops or persists.

Other symptoms worsening — if temp stays elevated AND he's more lethargic, not drinking, breathing harder, call pediatrician.

George dropped from 102.5 to 98.8 after one dose of motrin and stayed there. Ringo's oscillating more. If his 5pm reading is still 100+, consider motrin instead (longer-acting) or call for guidance.
