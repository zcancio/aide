George's highest recorded temperature: 103.0°F at 4pm on Dec 30.

ER guidelines typically recommend seeking care for:
- Temp ≥104°F
- Fever lasting >3 days (George is on day 3)
- Difficulty breathing, severe dehydration, lethargy, or other concerning symptoms

The snapshot shows George threw up at 2pm Dec 30 and had eyelid swelling at 11:30am that day. Combined with sustained high temps and weak medication response, those symptoms warrant calling your pediatrician or considering urgent care — especially if the swelling persists or new symptoms appear.
