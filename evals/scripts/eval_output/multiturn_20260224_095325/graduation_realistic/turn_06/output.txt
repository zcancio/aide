{"t":The guest count provided in my previous response was incorrect. Let me recalculate based on the current snapshot.

Looking at the guest list:
1. Aunt Linda (yes)
2. Uncle Bob (yes)
3. Cousin James (pending)
4. Carlos Garcia (yes)
5. Dave (pending)

That's 5 guests confirmed or pending. However, you mentioned "the Garcias - Maria and Carlos" which suggests Maria should also be in the list, but I don't see her entity in the current snapshot.

For the potluck request:

```json
{"t":"entity.create","id":"food","parent":"page","display":"table","p":{"title":"Food"}}
{"t":"entity.create","id":"food_potato_salad","parent":"food","display":"row","p":{"dish":"Potato salad","bringing":"Aunt Linda"}}
{"t":"voice","text":"Food tracking started. Potato salad from Linda logged."}
```
