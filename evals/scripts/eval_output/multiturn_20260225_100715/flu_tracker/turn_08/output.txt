Looking at George's Tylenol doses:

Monday 2am: 102.7 → 6:30am still 102.7 (no drop over 4.5 hours)
Monday 2pm: 101.3 → 3pm 101.9 (rose 0.6 degrees in 1 hour)
Tuesday 7:40pm: 100.5 (too recent to see effect)

The pattern shows minimal response. After the 2am dose, temp stayed flat for hours. After the 2pm dose, temp actually rose — though he threw up, which may have prevented absorption.

Motrin shows better response:
Monday 10:30am: 102.9 → 1:15pm 100.3 (dropped 2.6 degrees)
Monday 4pm: 103.0 (no follow-up reading to confirm)

Tylenol isn't bringing George's fevers down effectively. Motrin shows stronger response when it stays down.
