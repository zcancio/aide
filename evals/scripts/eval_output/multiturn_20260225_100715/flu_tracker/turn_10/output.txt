George's highest: 103.0°F at 4pm Monday.

That's below the typical ER threshold (105°F or persistent 104°F). Concerning signs that would warrant ER:
- Temp stays above 104°F despite meds
- Difficulty breathing
- Severe lethargy or unresponsiveness
- Persistent vomiting (he threw up once Monday 2pm)
- Eyelid swelling worsening (noted Monday 11:30am)

Current trajectory: peaked Monday afternoon, dropped to 100.5 by Tuesday evening. If temp spikes back above 103°F tonight or swelling/vomiting return, call pediatrician. Otherwise, trend looks like he's improving.
