George's highest: 103°F at 4pm on Dec 30.

ER guidance typically says go if:
- Temp sustained above 104°F
- Fever lasts more than 3 days
- Difficulty breathing, severe lethargy, or other alarming symptoms

George hit 103°F once, dropped to 100.5°F most recently. The eyelid swelling and vomiting are concerning — if swelling worsens, breathing becomes labored, or he becomes unresponsive, go immediately. For persistent fever beyond 72 hours or if he spikes above 104°F, call the pediatrician or go to ER.
