Tylenol isn't working well for George. Looking at his readings:

Dec 30, 6:30am — 102.7° with tylenol
Dec 30, 9:25am — still 101° (2.75 hours later, minimal drop)

Dec 30, 2pm — 101.3° with tylenol
Dec 30, 3pm — 101.9° one hour later (went UP)

Jan 2, 7:40pm — 100.5° with tylenol
(no follow-up reading yet to see response)

Motrin drops his fever more effectively. After motrin at 10:30am on Dec 30, he went from 102.9° to 100.3° in 2.75 hours. After motrin at 4pm, no reading yet but the pattern shows better response than tylenol.

Tylenol either does nothing or he rebounds quickly. Motrin gets better results.
