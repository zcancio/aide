George is worse. His fever is spiking higher (103° at 4pm vs Ringo's 101.4° at 2pm) and he's having complications — eyelid swelling at 11:30am and vomiting at 2pm. His temperatures are also staying elevated longer between meds.

Ringo's pattern shows improvement. After the 2am spike (103.5°), his readings dropped to normal by 6:30am (98.6°) and have stayed in the 99-101° range through the day.

George needs closer monitoring. The swelling and vomiting are concerning signs on top of the persistent high fever.
