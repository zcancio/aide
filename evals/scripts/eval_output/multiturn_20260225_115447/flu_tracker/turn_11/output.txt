George's highest was 103° at 4pm Monday (Dec 30). That's high but not ER-urgent on its own. 

The concerning pattern: eyelid swelling at 11:30am Monday and vomiting at 2pm. If the swelling worsens, breathing becomes labored, he's lethargic despite fever dropping, or he stops keeping fluids down — those are ER triggers.

Right now: monitor closely. If fever spikes above 103° again or new symptoms appear, call the pediatrician or go in.
